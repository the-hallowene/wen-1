<p>Every day would have a different theme and you would dress up according to what the theme is. There’s just something about the camaraderie, fun, school spirit and school pride that unites the student body; In anticipation of halloween, the upper elementary school is celebrating “halloween spirit week” the week of october 26. 💛🖤 send pics of you participating in the theme day and positive activity to <a href="mailto:wcps.photos@woodford.kyschools.us">wcps.photos@woodford.kyschools.us</a> or to @woodfordcountyschools. Spirit days can be fun scattered throughout the year or all in one week.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you want to create fun, unique daily themes to keep the kids engaged and entertained. This moment in history allows your school the chance to not only document, but honor our essential personnel who are working tirelessly each day to. I’ve been in charge of student council for about 7 years so we’ve had to come up with a lot of fun days for the school. Some of the activity links go straight to a pin on pinterest instead of a blog page. Open since 1983, spirit halloween offers a unique, frightfully fun experience unlike any other stores in the business.</p>
