<p>Halloween is celebrated every year on october 31, as pumpkins are carved and costumed trick or treaters head out to knock for sweets. The tradition originated with the ancient celtic festival of samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. The current halloween holiday comes from an old celtic celebration called all hallows eve (translated to all saints day). Halloween is right around the corner and fans of scares are gearing up for their best tricks and treats. Halloween or day additionally called all halloween, all hallows’ eve, or all saints’ eve, is a celebration ascertained in many countries on 31st of october , the eve of western christian feast of halloween day.</p>
