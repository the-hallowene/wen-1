<p>See if you can donate leftover pumpkins to zoos, animal shelters, farms, or community gardens. Here are just a few top ideas to consider: Here are a few clever ways that you can use old pumpkins, even after they’ve been carved! Toss the rinsed seeds with a little olive oil, sprinkle. I suggest an acorn squash.</p>

<p>Things to do with pumpkins after halloween: After halloween, don�t trash your pumpkins: Fresh pumpkins are 90% water, and they are a fruit, according to the university of illinois extension. However, with the decline of the carved pumpkin as the winter winds approach, one must find a way to dispose of one’s pumpkins. If your pumpkins didn’t experience a freeze and aren’t too old, you can try recycling pumpkins into décor for thanksgiving or to add a fall touch to the home.</p>
