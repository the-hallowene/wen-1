<p>For the first time since world war ii, people in all parts of the world will be able to see the oct. It hasn’t happened since 2001. The moon isn�t really blue, but will be in full bloom to make things a tad bit spookier on halloween. Even though the full blue moon is supposed to fall on the same day every 19. It is a rare phenomenon that occurs every 2 years and only this year, the blue moon will appear on the same day as halloween.</p>

<p>Blue moons that occur on halloween are even rarer. The last time such a wonder was seen on halloween was in 1944 and as indicated by nasa the next halloween blue moon will happen in 2039! 1906, 1925, 1944, 1955, 1974, 1993, 2001, 2020, 2039, 2058, 2077, and 2096. Halloween will hang on in the night skies all this week and over the next few weeks. Halloween’s full moon will be extra special, since it will be the second of the month and, therefore, a “blue moon.”</p>
