<p>Scott donned up as dc’s dark knight, batman for halloween, to receive criticism from the followers. The rapper travis scott has deleted his instagram account after his batman halloween costume was criticised by social media fans. The photograph was ridiculed by travis scott�s instagram followers, with scott proceeding to react by deleting his instagram account. Travis scott was just one of them. The shape and style of the costume appeared in line with 1992 batman returns� take on the outfit, but the color was, well, a bit off.</p>

<p>American rapper travis scott was one of the many celebs to share their halloween 2020 costumes on instagram, but his got more attention than he was possibly hoping for. Travis scott was very proud of his batman halloween costume, but the rapper�s dark knight look ended up getting roasted by fans. Travis scott deleted his instagram account after getting mocked for his halloween costume. That was a smart move (because hey, arianna grande can only call out so many people, she’s a busy person, folks) and travis scott was one of these celebrities. Scott donned up as dc’s dark knight, batman for halloween, to receive criticism from the followers.</p>
