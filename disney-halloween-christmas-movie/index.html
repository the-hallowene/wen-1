<p>The nightmare before christmas was a huge success for the disney company and continues to be a cult classic today. Those who are too squeamish for regular horror movies full of gore and jump.

A very merry pooh year. Team mickey with minnie who is dressed as a cat with long black tail, orange dress details and little grey cat ears for the ultimate halloween pairing.</p>
