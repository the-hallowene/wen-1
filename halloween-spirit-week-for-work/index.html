<p>I just want to work with that. Spirit halloween has one single goal, to deliver the very best halloween experience possible to all of our guests. Opportunity to work with really cool group of people, store discount, immerse yourself in halloween/horror fun for three months cons lackluster pay, position is temporary, setting up the stores is a lot of hard, heavy, unpleasant work, erratic schedule (store hrs change every week) Their fleeting presence make them more mysterious than most stores. And it inspired me to create this list of spirit week ideas.</p>
