<p>Yes, i have pictures to prove it. In canada and ireland, the celebrations are similar, but in england, halloween is generally not celebrated at all. Think of the gory and abhorrent ‘tricks’ people would commit in the name of halloween; We have halloween every day in iran. But we do have a very holy festival for our ancestors and dead souls.</p>

<p>Well technically, we have been celebrating a hybrid version of halloween since childhood now. Though it’s purely a western celebration, however, just like other festivals that we adopt from west, this one has successfully been adopted by us indians. Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on october 31, and halloween 2020 will occur on saturday, october 31. Still we have seen lots of people wanting to know more about why is halloween celebrated? Why is halloween celebrated on 31st october?</p>

<p>Is halloween celebrated in india? Why we should not celebrate halloween in india is not about how it is not a part of hindu culture and blah blah blah. Gradually, this day began to be celebrated with fun as a festival. Legend has it that people would also wear masks or other disguises and blacken their faces to try and pass unnoticed by the spirits. On the 31 st of october, they pay obeisance to the sun as their chief god.</p>
