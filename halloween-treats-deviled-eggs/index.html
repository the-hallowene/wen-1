<p>I am looking for halloween themed deviled egg ideas. Peel the eggs and cut a thin sliver of white off the wider bottom of the eggs so that the eggs can stand up. Use straws to punch out eyes, nose teeth in egg white, then either serve them as hard boiled eggs, or cut in half and make deviled egg mix to fill them and close them back up! Looking for something to give your halloween party guests a jump? A great spooky treat for a halloween party!</p>

<p>I love, love deviled eggs. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the peel and slice them in half lengthways. I love, love deviled eggs. Whirl 1 large heirloom tomato (8 oz., chopped) in a blender until smooth. Strain into 2 highball glasses.</p>
