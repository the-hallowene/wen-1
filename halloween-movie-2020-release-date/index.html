<p>Originally scheduled for release on october 16 2020, the film was put on the shelf due to wuhan coronavirus and all movie theaters in the world being closed. Green will direct both films and curtis will star. Theatrical after the success of the 2018 movie, david gordon green returns to direct with judy greer, jamie lee curtis, and andi matichak reprising their roles. Halloween kills is staying put on its 16 october, 2020 release date. However, in the interests of not rushing the series (and ending up having to reboot it again), we would guess that an october 2020 release date is more.</p>
