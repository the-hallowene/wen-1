All of the ideas below only use items that you already have around the house so there will be no other costs involved unless you want to buy small prizes for the winners. Adult party games are also a great way to entertain your guests and make your party more memorable.</p>

<p>Consider a theme for your adult party and build your food, games, and party decorations around it. Before the party, make cards with questions about details of decoration that your friends (in groups) will try to answer. Whether you have a group of toddlers, tweens, adults, or seniors to entertain, there are plenty of festive (and, err, creepy) ways to keep everyone busy and kick up the fright factor. An “icebreaker” is an activity that helps guests to get to know each other. By meaghan murphy and amanda garrity</p>

<p>Put a spin on some traditional fall games to make them a little more, well — interesting. Before the party, make cards with questions about details of decoration that your friends (in groups) will try to answer. Plus, they use items you likely already have around your house, so you. We say halloween is a great time for us adults to get together and have some good ol’ fashioned fun! Those vodka bottles aren’t going to fish themselves.</p>
