<p>Spirit halloween stores are only open in the fall during the time around halloween. Since these stores aren�t open year round, the company opened an online store. Earlier this week, a letter allegedly signed by the store had fans wondering if they’ll even open up this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. The online store is always open, so customers can order halloween costumes all year. Open since 1983, spirit halloween offers a unique, frightfully fun experience unlike any other stores in the business.</p>
