The candy slide looks really easy to make and consists of pvc pipe, glue, cheesecloth, paint and skeleton decorations. We call it the halloween candy slide. They used a long pvc pipe for the tube slide and several smaller pipes as a stand, decorating the construction with a spooky skeleton as a finishing touch.</p>

<p>One couple of youtubers, jamie and jay, thought up an ingenious way to make sure kids can still practice social distancing when visiting their home. Grab rain gutter supplies and create this ramp to delivery candy. The wicked makers posted a video to their youtube channel that teaches you how to make a simple diy device that could assist in social distancing. #raingutter #homedepot #sociallydistanttrickorteating #sociallydistanthalloween #candydelivery #halloween2020 #halloween Diy youtubers wicked makers made a genius candy slide.</p>

<p>While the candy slide promotes a level of social distancing, it�ll be important to remind kids to stand apart as they walk from house to house and especially as they go to collect candy. The candy slide looks really easy to make and consists of pvc pipe, glue, cheesecloth, paint and skeleton decorations. Would you consider making your own halloween candy slide? There are plenty of ways to hand out candy while upholding social distancing practices. Wicked makers has the perfect solution to this issue and we are absolutely bowled over.</p>

<p>In quebec, a clever canadian already pioneered an epic candy slide that would allow for social distancing. I will be absolutely heartbroken if halloween is canceled. The candy could simply be transferred by putting it into the tube, and then it would slide out to the other end into the child�s basket. Take a look at the working of the chute: At the other end, the children can access it easily and take their candy.</p>
